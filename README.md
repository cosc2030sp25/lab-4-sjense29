Asked ChatGPT how to pop in pyhton because I forgot. 

----------------------------
ok. so. the logic was there in your python program, but it doesn't run because the indentation is inconsistent. because python sucks. in your stringReverse function there were also some significant errors, mainly with the way that you were referencing the stack and the string. always double check that you're using the same variables. I've attached a modified version of your submission that works if you have any questions.\
but anyway. your c++ program looks great. 8.5/10
